# **🐍 Python Learning Journey**  

👋 **Welcome!** This folder is part of my **Full-Stack Foundations** roadmap, where I’ll be documenting everything I learn about **Python**—from the basics to advanced topics, data structures & algorithms (DSA), projects, and interview preparation.  

**📌 Goal:** Re-learn Python **systematically** and apply it in **real-world projects & interviews**. 🚀
